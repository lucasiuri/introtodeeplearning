        "Conveniently, TensorFlow has defined a number of ```Layers``` that are commonly used in neural networks, for example a [```Dense```](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense?version=stable). Now, instead of using a single ```Layer``` to define our simple neural network, we'll use the  [`Sequential`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential) model from Keras and a single [`Dense` ](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense) layer to define our network. With the `Sequential` API, you can readily create neural networks by stacking together layers like building blocks."

The `Model` class captures what we refer to as a \"model\" or as a \"network\".
